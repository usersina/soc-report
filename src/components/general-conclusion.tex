\section*{General Conclusion}
Throughout the course of this project, we have successfully designed and implemented a robust Security Operations Center (\glsxtrshort{soc}).
This \glsxtrshort{soc} serves as a comprehensive solution for continuous monitoring, analysis, and response to cyber threats, thereby addressing the paramount concern of cybersecurity for organizations globally.

The realization of this project was a significant opportunity to delve into the various aspects of building a \glsxtrshort{soc}, from defining objectives and requirements, selecting tools, designing the architecture, to integrating, testing, and operationalizing the system
Each step was meticulously outlined and executed, emphasizing the importance of continuous improvement in navigating evolving threats.

To successfully finalize this project, significant dedication and effort were required.
However, the knowledge and experience gained throughout this process have been invaluable.
Looking forward, we aim to further enhance the \glsxtrshort{soc} by incorporating advanced threat detection algorithms, automating more processes, and integrating more artifical intelligence and potentially generative AI to predict future threats.
We also plan to continuously monitor and update the system to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats.

Finally, we hope that this report has provided readers with a comprehensive understanding of the critical components and strategic considerations involved in establishing a \glsxtrshort{soc}. We believe that the insights gained from this project will be instrumental in furthering the field of cybersecurity.
