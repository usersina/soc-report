\section*{General Introduction}
Nowadays, cybersecurity stands as a paramount concern for organizations globally. It is a field that is rapidly evolving, with new threats emerging on a daily basis. As such, it is more important than ever for organizations to have robust security measures in place. Establishing a \glsxtrfull{soc} is one such measure that has proven to be imperative in addressing these challenges effectively. A SoC serves as a centralized unit that is dedicated to identifying, investigating, and responding to potential security threats. In this report, we'll delve into the intricacies of designing and implementing a tailored SoC. This SoC will serve as a hub for continuous monitoring, analysis, and response to cyber threats.

Our journey begins with defining the objectives, scope, and requirements of the SoC initiative. From meticulous tool selection to architectural design, each step will be carefully outlined. Integration, testing, and operationalization will be detailed, emphasizing the importance of continuous improvement in navigating evolving threats.

By the conclusion of this report, readers will gain invaluable insights into the critical components and strategic considerations underpinning the establishment of a SoC.
